# üõ°Ô∏è Windows Event Monitoring & Azure Attack Lab

This repository documents my personal cybersecurity lab focused on detecting, exporting, and analyzing attack activity against a Windows VM hosted in **Microsoft Azure**.  
The goal of this project was to simulate a real-world blue team scenario: monitoring logon activity, identifying attack sources, and mapping network activity.

## üß† Project Summary

- Monitored **Windows Security, System, and Application** logs from an Azure-hosted VM.
- Exported relevant logs to `.evtx` and `.csv` formats for offline analysis.
- Identified failed and successful logon attempts (`Event ID 4625` and `4624`).
- Mapped attacker IP addresses through **GeoIP** lookups.
- Generated a simple attack map and network topology visualization.
- Integrated the VM with **Azure Sentinel** for security monitoring and alerting.

## üïµÔ∏è Key Observations

- Multiple failed RDP login attempts (Event ID 4625) from external IPs.  
- Attackers originated from various countries (GeoIP lookup).  
- Event Viewer logs provided timeline and user context for each attempt.  
- Network topology matched the flow of external attempts to the VM endpoint.  
- Sentinel rules successfully ingested alerts.

## üöÄ How to Recreate This Lab

1. Deploy a Windows VM on Azure.  
2. Enable Network Watcher and configure security logging.  
3. Expose RDP for a limited period to attract brute force attempts.  
4. Collect Security, System, and Application logs with PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   wevtutil epl System system.evtx
   wevtutil epl Application application.evtx
   Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4624,4625} |
   Export-Csv security_logons_last7days.csv -NoTypeInformation
